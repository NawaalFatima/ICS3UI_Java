 * Youâ€™ve been hired to clean pools for the month of July. You have to work every day (31
    days) but your boss has agreed to pay you $0.01 on the 1 st , $0.02 on the 2 nd , $0.04 on
     the 3 rd and so on, so that each day you make twice what you made the day before.
     Make a table (lined up as best you can), showing the date, your pay for that day, and
       your total pay up to and including that day.
